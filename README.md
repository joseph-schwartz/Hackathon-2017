I made this game with in a team for a Hackathon in 2017.  I fixed most of the bugs and uploaded it 6-24/2022.
We took 2nd place and won a cash prize for our efforts.




The team: 
Joe Schwartz
Luke Lamberg

Brandon Michalowski also helped, though he had to go early so his main contribution was the level background.
